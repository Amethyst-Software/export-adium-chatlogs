# Export Adium Chatlogs
This Bash script (written in macOS) uses 'xsltproc' to convert Adium .chatlog files to RTF. Other destination formats are fairly easy to add if you're willing to make an XSLT stylesheet for them. For documentation, run "export_adium_chatlogs.sh --help". A preview of the help page is below to give you a feel for what the program does.
